## Simple

Sarah's (gorgeous) [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) is 90%+ perfect for me! There are just a couple of things that I wanted to adjust.
I've ~wasted~ spent many hours tweaking and [generating iTerm and Vim](https://github.com/ItsJonQ/base16-builder) themes. From this, I've learned that the easiest way (for me) to make fine-tune adjustments would be to distill the colour palette down to as few variables as possible.

## Generate

This is the magic sauce for Owlet's themes!

### Setup

This project only has a couple of dependencies, which it uses to generate the VS Code `theme.json` files.

To install the dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

To build the theme file(s), run:

```
npm start
```

### Theme files

An Owlet theme only really requires a single shade, which makes up the background.

**Example**

```js
// themes/palenight.js
const colors = require("../colors/default");

const config = {
  name: "Owlet (Palenight)",
  type: "dark"
};

const shades = {
  background: "#292d3e"
};

module.exports = {
  config,
  shades,
  colors
};
```

The theme is generated into `/themes/`, with it's details added to `package.json` - ready for publishing!
